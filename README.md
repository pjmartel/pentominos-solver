# pentominos-solver
Solvers for pentominos tiling problems



psolver.py - non-graphical solver, returns
             solution as a text array with
			 numbers 1 to 12 for the 12 pieces.
			 Can tile boards of various sizes with
			 subsets of the 12 pieces placed in 
			 arbitrary order ("-P" option).
			 By default returns only the first
			 solution found, but this behaviour can
			 be changed with the "-A" option (finds
			 all solutions).
